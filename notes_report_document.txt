The Append function scales better with a big O(n). While it starts off almost half as fast 
for the tiny array, it's already a bit faster by the small array and
by the extraLargeArray it's only 4 miliseconds while the Insert method
takes nearly two entire seconds that's like 500 times faster.

This is because the unshift array method that the Insert function utilizes
essentially has a loop in the implementation, causing the algorithm to
be O(n^2) because its equivalent to a nested loop over the inputed array.
